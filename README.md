# Conditional-Columns-If-And
Here, I worked on a data set, having the candidates id, cv value score and also the application package score.
The idea is to know the canditate that qualified and the candidate that was rejected.
Where the sum of cv value and application package score must be greater or equals to 13 to be qualified, else disqualified.
